# About
This is a website created for my mom's restaurant as the old one was outdated and hard to utilize. There are three different locations and all orders are taken online, so I focused on ensuring simplicity and ease of use for the daily 300+ customers. I wanted to maximize search engine visibility and image optimization, so after talking to a few mentors, I decided to use Next.js. I also ensured that the website was responsive to all screen sizes and devices as customers with non-Apple devices would sometimes run into trouble. I used the Google Maps API to embed a Google Maps frame with the restaurant locations.
